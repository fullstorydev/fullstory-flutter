# fullstory_flutter

`fullstory_flutter` provides Fullstory autocapture capabilities to support
session replay by integrating with the existing Fullstory Native Mobile SDKs.

This plug-in is intended to be used in conjunction with [Fullstory for Mobile Apps](https://www.fullstory.com/mobile-apps/).

⚠️ *This plugin is currently in Early Access.* Some breaking changes are possible before the 1.0.0 release. You may encounter bugs in visual session replay during the Early Access.

## Setting up Flutter session replay

1. Update to Flutter 3.32 or higher.
2. Follow the
   [directions](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/27461129353239)
   to set up the public `fullstory_flutter` plugin and ensure it is working as
   expected.
3. Update Android and iOS SDKs to a minimum version of 1.68.0.

5. In the app's `main.dart` (or wherever the app is started) replace
   `runApp($YourAppHere$)` with `runFullstoryApp($YourAppHere$)` and add
   `import 'package:fullstory_flutter/fullstory_flutter.dart';`. If you use
   `runWidget`, `runFullstoryWidget` should be used instead.
6. Run the app again and ensure that a session is successfully captured.

## Optional additional setup

If you wish to enable additional data capture, such as pages, crashes, and
network requests, please follow the steps in our
[developer documentation](https://developer.fullstory.com/mobile/flutter/).

## Custom classes and attributes

Use `FSCustomAttributes` to add custom classes or attributes to your widgets.
Wrap the widget you want to annotate with `FSCustomAttributes` and add any
classes or attributes you wish to include.

### Example usage

```dart
FSCustomAttributes {
  classes: ['class1', 'class2'],
  attributes: {'field1': 'value1'},
  child: YourAnnotatedWidget(),
}
```

## Known Issues

- Not compatible with tools and frameworks like
  [Patrol](https://patrol.leancode.co/), which also use custom bindings. 
  Please contact us to determine a way to
  combine our binding with your framework’s.
- Recovery for Flutter is not currently supported, so if a session is recovered,
  flutter elements may not be available for some part of a session.
- Apps which have multiple FlutterViews on screen at the same time aren’t
  supported yet. Please contact us if you use multiple FlutterViews.
